var is always used to define a variable
prompt() creates a pop-up with whatever text you want

alert(); puts an alert on the top of the screen that has an "ok" button by default
prompt(); is like alert(); but allows user input

the keyword "function" is how you define a function

can create "objects" just by using curly braces when defining a variable

using keyword "this" is the equivalent of python3's "self"

document.getElementsByClassName(); allows you to store HTML data inside JS

this.style.'*' allows CSS-like control over the page

this.addEventListener(); adds event listeners to objects on-page

this.classList.add(x, func); or this.classList.toggle(x, func); takes a function func and applies it to object x after a specific event
